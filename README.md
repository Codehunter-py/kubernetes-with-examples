# Kubernetes with Examples

Welcome to **Kubernetes with Examples** â€“ a repository dedicated to Kubernetes for DevOps, featuring practical scripts from real-world projects and open-source resources. This serves as a hands-on reference for automating, deploying, and managing Kubernetes workloads efficiently.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Currently, the repository includes the following directories:

```
ðŸ“¦ kubernetes-with-examples

```

More scripts and examples will be added as I progress through my learning and projects.
